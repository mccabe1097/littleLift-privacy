<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">LittleLift — Daily Mental Health Check-In App<br>Effective Date: February 23, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>

<p>LittleLift ("we," "our," or "the App") is developed and operated by Kyle McCabe. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your information when you use the LittleLift iOS app, Apple Watch companion app, and associated widgets (collectively, the "Service").</p>

<p>By downloading, installing, or using LittleLift, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Check-In Data:</strong> Mood selection (1–5 scale), energy level (1–5 scale), optional tags (e.g., "work stress," "gratitude"), optional one-word description, and optional text response to a daily prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Free-form text entries with optional mood selection (premium feature).</li>
    <li><strong>Breathing Exercise Data:</strong> Session completion and duration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Health Data (Apple HealthKit)</h3>
<p>If you explicitly enable HealthKit integration in Settings (premium feature, opt-in only), LittleLift may:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Write:</strong> Mindful minutes data to Apple Health after check-ins (60 seconds) and breathing exercises (actual session duration).</li>
    <li><strong>Read:</strong> Sleep analysis data from Apple Health to display a Sleep &amp; Mood correlation chart in the Insights tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Health data collected through Apple HealthKit is never sold, shared with third parties, used for advertising, or transferred to data brokers. Health data is used solely to provide app features you have explicitly enabled. HealthKit data is not stored on any external server — it remains on your device and in Apple Health.</p>

<h3>1.3 Subscription &amp; Purchase Data</h3>
<p>Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card number, or Apple ID. We only receive a transaction verification status (active/expired) from Apple's StoreKit framework to determine your subscription status.</p>

<h3>1.4 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Time &amp; Date:</strong> Used for time-of-day theming, streak calculation, and scheduling notification reminders.</li>
    <li><strong>System Boot Time:</strong> Used by the system framework for internal timing (declared in our Privacy Manifest).</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</li>
    <li>We do not collect device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV) for tracking purposes.</li>
    <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
    <li>We do not collect contacts, photos, or camera data.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics SDKs, crash reporting services, or third-party tracking tools.</li>
    <li>We do not create user accounts or require login credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI-Powered Responses:</strong> When you complete a check-in (premium feature), your mood, energy, tags, one-word, and prompt response are sent to our secure API proxy to generate a personalized AI response (message, affirmation, and micro-action). This data is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers after the response is generated.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Affirmations:</strong> Aggregated mood and energy context may be sent to our API proxy to generate a personalized daily affirmation (premium feature).</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Insights:</strong> Your check-in history for the current week may be sent to our API proxy to generate a weekly AI insight report (premium feature). This data is processed in real-time and is not retained on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Insights &amp; Charts:</strong> Your check-in and journal data are used locally on your device to generate mood trends, energy charts, tag frequency analysis, and word cloud visualizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Streak &amp; Garden:</strong> Check-in dates are used locally to calculate your daily streak and progress your Growth Garden plants.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If enabled (premium feature, opt-in only), we schedule local push notifications for daily check-in reminders. These are processed entirely on-device.</li>
    <li><strong>Crisis Detection:</strong> Text inputs are scanned on-device for crisis-related keywords. If detected, we display crisis resources (988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, Crisis Text Line). No crisis detection data is transmitted externally — all processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> You may export your check-in data as CSV or PDF files (premium feature). Exported files are generated on-device and shared via the iOS share sheet — we do not receive copies of exported data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>

<h3>3.1 On-Device Storage</h3>
<p>All personal data (check-ins, journal entries, garden progress, cached affirmations, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and UserDefaults, within a shared App Group container. This data is protected by iOS device encryption and is not accessible to other apps.</p>

<h3>3.2 No User Accounts</h3>
<p>LittleLift does not require user accounts, login credentials, or registration. There is no user database. Your data lives only on your device (and your iCloud backup, if you have enabled iCloud device backups through Apple).</p>

<h3>3.3 API Proxy</h3>
<p>AI-powered features (check-in responses, affirmations, weekly insights) are processed through a secure API proxy hosted on Cloudflare Workers. This proxy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Receives check-in data only when you actively use a premium AI feature.</li>
    <li>Forwards requests to Anthropic's Claude AI for processing.</li>
    <li>Does not log, store, or retain your personal data after the response is generated.</li>
    <li>Uses HTTPS encryption for all data in transit.</li>
    <li>Authenticates requests using a shared application token (not tied to your identity).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.4 Third-Party AI Processing (Anthropic)</h3>
<p>When you use premium AI features, your check-in data is processed by Anthropic's Claude AI (Haiku model) through our API proxy. Anthropic's data handling is governed by their own privacy policy and terms of service, available at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">anthropic.com/privacy</a>. Per Anthropic's API terms, data submitted through the API is not used to train their models.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal information to any third party. We share data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Check-in data is transmitted to our API proxy (Cloudflare Workers) and then to Anthropic's Claude API solely for the purpose of generating personalized AI responses. This data is not retained after processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Subscription purchase data is processed by Apple. HealthKit data is shared with Apple Health only if you explicitly enable the integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> If you use the share feature (streak cards, insight cards, data export), you control where that data is shared via the iOS share sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

<h3>5.1 On-Device Data</h3>
<p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as you use the App. You can delete all data at any time via Settings → "Delete All Data," which permanently removes all check-ins, journal entries, and garden progress from your device.</p>

<h3>5.2 Uninstalling the App</h3>
<p>Uninstalling LittleLift from your device removes all locally stored data, including all check-ins, journal entries, garden data, cached affirmations, and preferences.</p>

<h3>5.3 Server-Side Data</h3>
<p>Our API proxy does not retain your data. Check-in data sent for AI processing is discarded immediately after the response is generated. There is no server-side database of user data to delete.</p>

<h3>5.4 Cached Data</h3>
<p>Daily affirmations and weekly insight reports are cached locally on your device (in UserDefaults) for up to 7–8 days for performance. These caches are automatically cleaned up and are deleted when you use "Delete All Data" or uninstall the App.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>LittleLift is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information. If you are under 13, please do not use this App.</p>
<p>For users between 13 and 17, we recommend parental guidance when using the App, particularly for features involving mental health check-ins.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>

<h3>7.1 Access &amp; Export</h3>
<p>You can view all your data within the App at any time. Premium subscribers can export their complete check-in history as CSV or PDF files via Settings → Export Data.</p>

<h3>7.2 Deletion</h3>
<p>You can delete all your data at any time via Settings → Delete All Data. You can also uninstall the App to remove all data from your device.</p>

<h3>7.3 HealthKit</h3>
<p>You can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time via iOS Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Health → LittleLift. You can also disable HealthKit integration within the App via Settings.</p>

<h3>7.4 Notifications</h3>
<p>You can disable push notifications at any time within the App (Settings) or via iOS Settings → Notifications → LittleLift.</p>

<h3>7.5 Opt-Out of AI Processing</h3>
<p>Free-tier users do not have any data sent to external servers for AI processing. If you are a premium subscriber and wish to stop AI data processing, you may cancel your subscription and continue using the free tier.</p>
