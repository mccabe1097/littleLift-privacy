<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="subtitle">LittleLift — Daily Mental Health Check-In App<br>Effective Date: February 23, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>

<p>LittleLift ("we," "our," or "the App") is developed and operated by Kyle McCabe. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your information when you use the LittleLift iOS app, Apple Watch companion app, and associated widgets (collectively, the "Service").</p>

<p>By downloading, installing, or using LittleLift, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Check-In Data:</strong> Mood selection (1–5 scale), energy level (1–5 scale), optional tags (e.g., "work stress," "gratitude"), optional one-word description, and optional text response to a daily prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Free-form text entries with optional mood selection (premium feature).</li>
    <li><strong>Breathing Exercise Data:</strong> Session completion and duration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Health Data (Apple HealthKit)</h3>
<p>If you explicitly enable HealthKit integration in Settings (premium feature, opt-in only), LittleLift may:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Write:</strong> Mindful minutes data to Apple Health after check-ins (60 seconds) and breathing exercises (actual session duration).</li>
    <li><strong>Read:</strong> Sleep analysis data from Apple Health to display a Sleep &amp; Mood correlation chart in the Insights tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Health data collected through Apple HealthKit is never sold, shared with third parties, used for advertising, or transferred to data brokers. Health data is used solely to provide app features you have explicitly enabled. HealthKit data is not stored on any external server — it remains on your device and in Apple Health.</p>

<h3>1.3 Subscription &amp; Purchase Data</h3>
<p>Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card number, or Apple ID. We only receive a transaction verification status (active/expired) from Apple's StoreKit framework to determine your subscription status.</p>

<h3>1.4 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Time &amp; Date:</strong> Used for time-of-day theming, streak calculation, and scheduling notification reminders.</li>
    <li><strong>System Boot Time:</strong> Used by the system framework for internal timing (declared in our Privacy Manifest).</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</li>
    <li>We do not collect device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV) for tracking purposes.</li>
    <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
    <li>We do not collect contacts, photos, or camera data.</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics SDKs, crash reporting services, or third-party tracking tools.</li>
    <li>We do not create user accounts or require login credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI-Powered Responses:</strong> When you complete a check-in (premium feature), your mood, energy, tags, one-word, and prompt response are sent to our secure API proxy to generate a personalized AI response (message, affirmation, and micro-action). This data is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers after the response is generated.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Affirmations:</strong> Aggregated mood and energy context may be sent to our API proxy to generate a personalized daily affirmation (premium feature).</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Insights:</strong> Your check-in history for the current week may be sent to our API proxy to generate a weekly AI insight report (premium feature). This data is processed in real-time and is not retained on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Insights &amp; Charts:</strong> Your check-in and journal data are used locally on your device to generate mood trends, energy charts, tag frequency analysis, and word cloud visualizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Streak &amp; Garden:</strong> Check-in dates are used locally to calculate your daily streak and progress your Growth Garden plants.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If enabled (premium feature, opt-in only), we schedule local push notifications for daily check-in reminders. These are processed entirely on-device.</li>
    <li><strong>Crisis Detection:</strong> Text inputs are scanned on-device for crisis-related keywords. If detected, we display crisis resources (988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, Crisis Text Line). No crisis detection data is transmitted externally — all processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> You may export your check-in data as CSV or PDF files (premium feature). Exported files are generated on-device and shared via the iOS share sheet — we do not receive copies of exported data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>

<h3>3.1 On-Device Storage</h3>
<p>All personal data (check-ins, journal entries, garden progress, cached affirmations, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and UserDefaults, within a shared App Group container. This data is protected by iOS device encryption and is not accessible to other apps.</p>

<h3>3.2 No User Accounts</h3>
<p>LittleLift does not require user accounts, login credentials, or registration. There is no user database. Your data lives only on your device (and your iCloud backup, if you have enabled iCloud device backups through Apple).</p>

<h3>3.3 API Proxy</h3>
<p>AI-powered features (check-in responses, affirmations, weekly insights) are processed through a secure API proxy hosted on Cloudflare Workers. This proxy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Receives check-in data only when you actively use a premium AI feature.</li>
    <li>Forwards requests to Anthropic's Claude AI for processing.</li>
    <li>Does not log, store, or retain your personal data after the response is generated.</li>
    <li>Uses HTTPS encryption for all data in transit.</li>
    <li>Authenticates requests using a shared application token (not tied to your identity).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.4 Third-Party AI Processing (Anthropic)</h3>
<p>When you use premium AI features, your check-in data is processed by Anthropic's Claude AI (Haiku model) through our API proxy. Anthropic's data handling is governed by their own privacy policy and terms of service, available at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank">anthropic.com/privacy</a>. Per Anthropic's API terms, data submitted through the API is not used to train their models.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, lease, or trade your personal information to any third party. We share data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Check-in data is transmitted to our API proxy (Cloudflare Workers) and then to Anthropic's Claude API solely for the purpose of generating personalized AI responses. This data is not retained after processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Subscription purchase data is processed by Apple. HealthKit data is shared with Apple Health only if you explicitly enable the integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> If you use the share feature (streak cards, insight cards, data export), you control where that data is shared via the iOS share sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

<h3>5.1 On-Device Data</h3>
<p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as you use the App. You can delete all data at any time via Settings → "Delete All Data," which permanently removes all check-ins, journal entries, and garden progress from your device.</p>

<h3>5.2 Uninstalling the App</h3>
<p>Uninstalling LittleLift from your device removes all locally stored data, including all check-ins, journal entries, garden data, cached affirmations, and preferences.</p>

<h3>5.3 Server-Side Data</h3>
<p>Our API proxy does not retain your data. Check-in data sent for AI processing is discarded immediately after the response is generated. There is no server-side database of user data to delete.</p>

<h3>5.4 Cached Data</h3>
<p>Daily affirmations and weekly insight reports are cached locally on your device (in UserDefaults) for up to 7–8 days for performance. These caches are automatically cleaned up and are deleted when you use "Delete All Data" or uninstall the App.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>LittleLift is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information. If you are under 13, please do not use this App.</p>
<p>For users between 13 and 17, we recommend parental guidance when using the App, particularly for features involving mental health check-ins.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>

<h3>7.1 Access &amp; Export</h3>
<p>You can view all your data within the App at any time. Premium subscribers can export their complete check-in history as CSV or PDF files via Settings → Export Data.</p>

<h3>7.2 Deletion</h3>
<p>You can delete all your data at any time via Settings → Delete All Data. You can also uninstall the App to remove all data from your device.</p>

<h3>7.3 HealthKit</h3>
<p>You can revoke HealthKit permissions at any time via iOS Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Health → LittleLift. You can also disable HealthKit integration within the App via Settings.</p>

<h3>7.4 Notifications</h3>
<p>You can disable push notifications at any time within the App (Settings) or via iOS Settings → Notifications → LittleLift.</p>

<h3>7.5 Opt-Out of AI Processing</h3>
<p>Free-tier users do not have any data sent to external servers for AI processing. If you are a premium subscriber and wish to stop AI data processing, you may cancel your subscription and continue using the free tier.</p>

<h2>8. European Economic Area (EEA) &amp; UK Residents — GDPR</h2>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you have the following rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</p>

<h2>9. California Residents — CCPA / CPRA</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provide you with specific rights:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to know what personal information we collect, use, and disclose. This is described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete all your data via Settings → Delete All Data.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> We do not sell your personal information. We have never sold personal information and have no plans to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA/CPRA rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Information:</strong> Health-related data (mood, energy, HealthKit data) is considered sensitive under CPRA. This data is used solely to provide App functionality and is never sold, shared for advertising, or used for profiling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Washington State Residents — My Health My Data Act</h2>
<p>If you are a Washington State resident, the My Health My Data Act provides you with specific protections for "consumer health data," which may include mood, energy, and wellness data collected by LittleLift:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We collect and process your health-related data only with your affirmative consent through your active use of the App's features. HealthKit integration requires additional explicit opt-in.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the App at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete all consumer health data via Settings → Delete All Data, or by uninstalling the App. Our API proxy does not retain your data, so there is no server-side data to delete.</li>
    <li><strong>No Sale of Health Data:</strong> We do not sell, share, or offer for sale any consumer health data.</li>
    <li><strong>Geofencing:</strong> We do not use geofencing technology around health care facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise your rights under this Act, contact us at <a href="mailto:kylemccabe1097@gmail.com">kylemccabe1097@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>11. Illinois Residents — Biometric Information (BIPA)</h2>
<p>LittleLift does not collect biometric identifiers or biometric information as defined under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). Mood selections, energy levels, and text inputs are self-reported behavioral data, not biometric data derived from physiological or biological characteristics. We do not use facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, voiceprint analysis, or any other biometric technology.</p>

<h2>12. HIPAA Disclaimer</h2>
<p>LittleLift is a consumer wellness application and is NOT a "covered entity" or "business associate" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The data you enter into LittleLift is not protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA. LittleLift is not an electronic health record and does not interface with healthcare providers, health plans, or health care clearinghouses.</p>

<h2>13. Data Breach Notification</h2>
<p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, the risk of a data breach on our end is minimal. However, in the unlikely event that our API proxy (Cloudflare Workers) or third-party AI provider (Anthropic) experiences a security incident that may have exposed data transmitted during AI processing, we will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigate the scope and nature of the incident promptly.</li>
    <li>Notify affected users via an in-app notice or update to this Privacy Policy as soon as reasonably practicable.</li>
    <li>Comply with all applicable data breach notification laws in relevant jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Since our API proxy does not retain data after processing, and since no personally identifiable information (name, email, account) is transmitted, the exposure risk from any server-side breach is limited to the content of individual check-in responses in transit.</p>

<h2>14. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>If you use premium AI features, your check-in data may be processed by servers located in the United States (Cloudflare Workers and Anthropic's API infrastructure). By using these features, you consent to the transfer of your data to the United States for processing. All transfers are encrypted via HTTPS.</p>

<h2>15. Third-Party Links &amp; Services</h2>
<p>LittleLift may display links to crisis resources (988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, Crisis Text Line) and Apple's standard Terms of Use. These are third-party services governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external services.</p>

<h2>16. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

<h2>17. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>

<h2>7. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AI responses, affirmations, micro-actions, and weekly insight reports are generated by third-party AI technology (Anthropic's Claude) and are provided "as is."</li>
    <li>AI-generated content may occasionally be inaccurate, inappropriate, or unhelpful. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of AI-generated content.</li>
    <li>AI-generated content may occasionally include statements that are emotionally insensitive, triggering, or otherwise distressing. If any AI-generated content causes you discomfort, please discontinue use and consult a qualified mental health professional.</li>
    <li>You should not rely on AI-generated content as a substitute for professional advice of any kind.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for any decisions you make, actions you take, or emotional responses you experience based on AI-generated content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. No Professional Relationship</h2>
<p>Use of LittleLift does not create a therapist-client, doctor-patient, counselor-client, or any other professional relationship between you and Kyle McCabe, Anthropic, or any other party. No duty of care arises from your use of the Service. The App does not provide professional mental health services, and no fiduciary or professional obligation exists between us and any user.</p>

<h2>9. Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You use LittleLift voluntarily and at your own risk.</li>
    <li>Engaging with mental health and wellness content, including mood tracking, journaling, and AI-generated responses, may evoke emotional reactions, including discomfort, sadness, or distress.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for your own mental health decisions and for seeking professional help when needed.</li>
    <li>The crisis detection feature uses keyword matching and may fail to detect crisis situations, may produce false positives, and is not a substitute for human crisis intervention.</li>
    <li>You will not hold Kyle McCabe or any affiliated party liable for any emotional, psychological, or physical harm arising from your use of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. User Content</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain all ownership rights to content you create within the App, including journal entries, check-in text, and one-word descriptions ("User Content").</li>
    <li><strong>License:</strong> By using the App, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process your User Content solely for the purpose of providing App features (e.g., transmitting check-in data to our API proxy for AI response generation). This license terminates when you delete your data or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for any content you create within the App. We do not monitor, review, or moderate User Content.</li>
    <li><strong>No Backup Obligation:</strong> We are not responsible for the loss of any User Content. Data is stored locally on your device and is not backed up by us. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups (e.g., via data export or iCloud device backups).</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Service Availability &amp; Modifications</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, with or without notice, for any reason.</li>
    <li>We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</li>
    <li>AI features depend on third-party services (Cloudflare, Anthropic) that are outside of our control. We do not guarantee the continued availability of AI-powered features.</li>
    <li>If Anthropic modifies or discontinues the Claude AI service, AI-powered features in LittleLift may become unavailable. In such cases, free-tier features (check-ins, calendar, garden, breathing exercises) will continue to function.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Force Majeure</h2>
<p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations under these Terms if such failure or delay results from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural disasters, acts of God, pandemics, war, terrorism, riots, government actions, power failures, internet or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, third-party service outages (including Cloudflare, Anthropic, or Apple), or any other force majeure event.</p>

<h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW:</strong></p>

    <li>WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY HARM, INJURY, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR RELIANCE ON AI-GENERATED CONTENT, CRISIS DETECTION FEATURES, OR ANY OTHER FEATURE OF THE SERVICE.</li>
    <li>THE CRISIS DETECTION FEATURE IS PROVIDED ON A BEST-EFFORT BASIS AND MAY NOT DETECT ALL CRISIS-RELATED CONTENT. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE CRISIS DETECTION SYSTEM.</li>
</ul>

However, we do not warrant full compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Section 508, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you experience accessibility issues, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kylemccabe1097@gmail.com">kylemccabe1097@gmail.com</a> and we will make reasonable efforts to address your concerns.</p>

<h2>18. Not an Insurance or Medical Device Product</h2>
<p>LittleLift is a consumer wellness application. It is not an insurance product, medical device, clinical tool, diagnostic instrument, or regulated health technology. It is not intended to be used for insurance underwriting, claims processing, risk assessment, or any purpose governed by insurance regulations. Mood and energy data collected by the App should not be used as evidence of medical conditions or treatment outcomes.</p>

<h2>21. Waiver</h2>

<h2>22. Assignment</h2>
<p>We may assign, transfer, or delegate our rights and obligations under these Terms to any third party without your consent, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law.

<h2>24. No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>

<p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Kyle McCabe regarding the use of LittleLift and supersede any prior agreements.</p>

<h2>27. Apple-Specific Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms are between you and Kyle McCabe, not Apple Inc. ("Apple"). Apple is not responsible for LittleLift or its content. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App, including product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement. Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance, Apple will have the right to enforce these Terms as a third-party beneficiary.</p>

<h2>28. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
